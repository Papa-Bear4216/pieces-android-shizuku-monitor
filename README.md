# pieces-android

Android companion for PiecesOS — Status, Recent, Ask, and an optional privileged toolkit
(Shizuku shell diagnostics + accessibility-based screen-text capture). Two ways to connect
the core app, both live:

- **Plan A (LAN)**: phone and PC on the same Wi-Fi, talking directly to a proxy on the PC.
- **Plan B (remote)**: phone anywhere with internet, routed through a gateway on a host you
  control over Tailscale back to the same PC — no inbound ports opened on the home network,
  fails closed if the PC is offline/unreachable.

## Optional: Shizuku toolkit (advanced, off by default)

The app can optionally use [Shizuku](https://shizuku.rikka.app/) — a separate app you install
yourself that grants ADB-level shell access without root — to run a small set of diagnostic
commands (`dumpsys battery`, `pm list packages -3`, etc.) and, if you also grant Android's
Accessibility permission, capture on-screen text **only from apps you explicitly select** in
an in-app picker. Both are sent to your own PiecesOS instance as context.

**This is off until you turn it on.** Nothing in this toolkit runs, and no permission is
requested, until you flip the toggle in the Setup screen. When you do:

- Shell commands are restricted to a fixed allowlist enforced in the Android app's Java code
  (`ShizukuMonitorPlugin.ALLOWED_COMMANDS`), not just the UI — the WebView cannot run
  arbitrary shell even if compromised.
- Screen-text capture only reads from packages you've added to the allowlist via the app
  picker (Status tab → "Choose allowed apps"). Known password-manager and banking app
  packages are excluded from that picker outright and cannot be selected.
- This still requires two separate manual grants on your end: installing Shizuku and
  starting its daemon (wireless debugging or root), and enabling Android's Accessibility
  service for this app in system Settings (or letting the app do it via Shizuku once you've
  opted in).

If you don't want any of this, ignore it — Status/Recent/Ask work fully without Shizuku or
Accessibility ever being touched.

## No data lost if the connection drops

Every telemetry event survives a broken link, at both hops:

- **Phone → proxy**: events queue in Capacitor Preferences (`apps/mobile/src/lib/usage.ts`)
  and only clear on a confirmed successful send. Any failure — offline, proxy down, home PC
  unreachable — leaves them queued for the next retry (on every screen navigation, plus a
  5-minute backstop timer).
- **Proxy → PiecesOS**: every event is written to a permanent, unconditional audit log
  (`USAGE_LOG_PATH`) the moment it's received, regardless of what happens next. If seeding
  it into PiecesOS fails (e.g. PiecesOS is restarting), it also goes into a separate durable
  retry queue (`SEED_QUEUE_PATH`, default `~/.claude/pieces-seed-queue.jsonl`) that a
  background loop drains every 30 seconds — on both a timer and proxy startup — until it
  succeeds or hits 50 attempts (~25 minutes), at which point it's dropped from the retry
  queue but remains in the permanent audit log either way.

### Passive mode (advanced, requires a second explicit confirmation)

By default, screen-text capture only happens when you tap "Scan Screen Text" — a single
on-demand snapshot. There's a separate, further-gated **passive mode** that instead pushes
captured text automatically, continuously, while an allowed app is in the foreground:

- Debounced: waits ~2 seconds after the screen stops changing before considering a push, so
  it doesn't fire on every keystroke/scroll.
- Deduped: skips the push if the text is identical to the last thing actually sent.
- Still scoped to the same per-app allowlist as manual capture — nothing outside apps you've
  explicitly selected.

Because this is meaningfully more invasive than a button press — it runs in the background,
repeatedly, without asking each time — enabling it requires typing a confirmation phrase in
the Status tab, on top of the toolkit opt-in and having at least one app allowlisted. It can
be turned off at any time from the same screen, and clearing the allowlist to zero apps
turns it off automatically.

apps/proxy/          Node HTTP proxy (Plan A) — bearer auth + deny-by-default allowlist in front of PiecesOS
apps/pieces-gateway/ Node HTTP gateway (Plan B) — JWT device auth + revoke, forwards to apps/proxy over Tailscale
apps/mobile/         Capacitor Android app (Setup / Status / Ask / Recent) — same UI works with either backend
packages/pieces-api/ Typed client for the handful of PiecesOS routes the proxy calls

```

## 1. Run the proxy (on the PC running PiecesOS)

```bash
cd apps/proxy
npm install

# generate a bearer token once, save it somewhere safe
node scripts/generate-token.mjs

# start the proxy
PROXY_BEARER_TOKEN=<paste-token-here> npm start
```

By default it listens on `0.0.0.0:8787` and proxies to PiecesOS at
`http://127.0.0.1:39300`. Override either with env vars if needed:

```bash
PROXY_PORT=8787 PIECES_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:39300 PROXY_BEARER_TOKEN=... npm start
```

**Before exposing this on your LAN**, restrict the port to your Private network profile —
run `apps/proxy/scripts/windows-firewall-rule.ps1` in an elevated PowerShell window. This
is a manual step by design; it is not run automatically by `npm start`.

To keep it running continuously (needed for Plan B, since the gateway depends on this
proxy being reachable at any time), register it as a Windows Scheduled Task instead of
running it manually — see `apps/proxy/scripts/register-service.ps1`. It defaults to S4U
mode (runs at boot and logon, no stored password required — appropriate if your Windows
account is passwordless). Run it once, elevated:

```powershell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "apps\proxy\scripts\register-service.ps1"
```

Find your PC's LAN IP (`ipconfig`, look for the IPv4 address on your home network
adapter) — the phone will need `http://<that-ip>:8787` for Plan A (LAN) mode.

## 2. (Optional) Set up Plan B — remote access via hermes-host + Tailscale

Skip this section if LAN-only access is enough for you.

Requirements: a Tailscale account (free tier is fine), and a Linux host reachable from the
internet with Docker + Caddy already fronting at least one domain (this was built against
an existing `hermes-host` GCE VM that already ran Caddy for another service — adapt paths
if yours differs).

1. **Join both machines to the same tailnet.** Install Tailscale on the PC running the
   Plan A proxy and on your remote host, then `tailscale up --authkey=<key>` on each
   (generate a reusable auth key at https://login.tailscale.com/admin/settings/keys).
   Verify: from the remote host, `curl http://<pc-tailnet-ip>:8787/mobile/health` should
   return `{"ok":true}` before proceeding — if it doesn't, nothing downstream will work.

2. **Copy `apps/pieces-gateway` and `packages/allowlist`** to the remote host (matching
   relative layout matters — the Dockerfile expects to be built with the repo root as
   context, see the comment at the top of `apps/pieces-gateway/Dockerfile`).

3. **Add a new service to your existing docker-compose.yml**, alongside whatever Caddy
   already fronts — see `apps/pieces-gateway/deploy/docker-compose.snippet.yml` for the
   exact block. Add `pieces-gateway` to Caddy's `depends_on` list too.

4. **Write a `.env` file** at `apps/pieces-gateway/.env` on the remote host (never commit
   this):
   ```
   GATEWAY_JWT_SECRET=<generate with: openssl rand -base64 32>
   HOME_PROXY_BASE_URL=http://<pc-tailnet-ip>:8787
   HOME_PROXY_TOKEN=<the same token from apps/proxy/.bearer-token>
   GATEWAY_PORT=8788
   ```

5. **Add a DNS A record** for whatever subdomain you want (e.g. `pieces.yourdomain.com`)
   pointing at the remote host's public IP, and a matching block in your Caddyfile:
   ```
   pieces.yourdomain.com {
       reverse_proxy pieces-gateway:8788
   }
   ```

6. **Build and start it**: `docker compose up -d --build pieces-gateway`, then
   `docker compose restart caddy` to pick up the new Caddyfile block. Watch
   `docker logs <caddy-container>` for `certificate obtained successfully` for your new
   hostname.

7. **Enroll a device**:
   ```bash
   docker exec --env-file apps/pieces-gateway/.env <gateway-container> npx tsx src/enroll-cli.ts "My Phone"
   ```
   This prints a device token — that's what goes in the phone's Setup screen alongside
   `https://pieces.yourdomain.com`.

To revoke a device later: `docker exec --env-file apps/pieces-gateway/.env <gateway-container> npx tsx src/revoke-cli.ts <deviceId>` (find the ID with `list-devices`).

## 3. Install the APK on your phone

A debug build already exists at
`apps/mobile/android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk` after running:

```bash
cd apps/mobile
npm install
npm run build
npx cap sync android
cd android
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

Sideload `app-debug.apk` onto your phone (enable "Install unknown apps" for whatever
transfer method you use — ADB, a file share, email to yourself, etc.).

## 4. Connect the app

Open the app → **Setup** tab. Same two fields either way — just different values:

**Plan A (on your home Wi-Fi):**
1. Server address: `http://<pc-lan-ip>:8787`
2. Token: the value from `apps/proxy/.bearer-token` on the PC

**Plan B (away from home, if you set it up):**
1. Server address: `https://pieces.yourdomain.com`
2. Token: the device token printed by `enroll-cli.ts`

Either way, tap **Test & Save** — it calls the server's unauthenticated `/mobile/health`
first to confirm reachability, then saves both values via Capacitor's native Preferences
storage. Once saved, **Status**, **Ask**, and **Recent** all use the saved address + token
automatically — switch between Plan A and Plan B any time by just changing Setup.

## Optional: Mem0 integration

If you set `MEM0_API_KEY` in the proxy's environment, Ask queries and captured telemetry
are also mirrored to your [Mem0](https://mem0.ai) account (`MEM0_USER_ID`, default
`pieces-android-user`). Entirely optional — leave both unset and this is skipped silently,
no error, no dependency on having a Mem0 account.

## Known limitations

- **Ask requires a model configured in PiecesOS.** If PiecesOS's answer-generation endpoints
  (`/qgpt/relevance` with a search scope, `/qgpt/question`) return HTTP 500, the app shows
  in-app guidance pointing at PiecesOS's Settings → Models/Copilot screen — this is a
  PiecesOS-side setup step, not a bug in the proxy or app. See `docs/ALLOWED_ROUTES.md` for
  the underlying evidence. Status and Recent don't depend on a model and work regardless.
- **Plan A proxy uptime** depends on staying logged into Windows — it's registered to run
  at boot and logon (no stored password, by design), but has not yet been proven to
  survive a fully unattended reboot with nobody signing back in. See `docs/ACCEPTANCE.md`
  for the exact gap and how to test it.
- **Plan B has not been tested from an actual phone on cellular/off-LAN network** — every
  Plan B behavior documented in `docs/ACCEPTANCE.md` was verified via `curl`, not from the
  installed APK itself.
