# Run this ONCE, in an ELEVATED PowerShell window (Run as Administrator).
# After this, restarting the proxy after a code change never needs elevation
# again - trigger it with the unprivileged `Start-ScheduledTask -TaskName
# "PiecesAndroidProxyRestart"`, and Task Scheduler (which already holds an
# elevated S4U token for this account) does the actual process kill.
#
# On-demand only - no recurring trigger. Registered with a trigger so it has
# one (Task Scheduler requires at least one), but that trigger fires far in
# the past and never recurs; the task is meant to be started manually/by us.
