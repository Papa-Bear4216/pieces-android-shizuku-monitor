# Run this once, in an ELEVATED PowerShell window (Run as Administrator).
# Registers the Plan A proxy as a Windows scheduled task.
#
# Three modes, controlled by the $Mode variable below:
#
#   "LogonOnly" (previous default) - "run only when logged on", mirrors the
#   tool-registry heartbeat's -AtLogOn pattern. No stored credentials needed.
#   Trade-off: proxy is unavailable whenever you are logged out or the PC
#   is at the sign-in screen after a reboot.
#
#   "S4U" (current default) - runs at boot AND at logon, using Windows'
#   Service-For-User logon type. No stored password needed - Windows mints
#   a token for the account instead of authenticating with a password. This
#   is the mode to use given the account is intentionally passwordless.
#   Caveat: has not been proven to survive an unattended reboot yet: if the
#   proxy directory ever becomes a OneDrive Files-On-Demand placeholder
#   (cloud-only, not hydrated), node/npx will fail to read it at pre-login
#   boot. Verified hydrated as of 2026-07-26 (Attributes: Archive, no
#   Offline/reparse flag) - re-check if this ever moves or OneDrive frees
#   space. See docs/ACCEPTANCE.md for the actual reboot-without-login test.
#
#   "LoggedOutWithPassword" - "run whether user is logged on or not" using a
#   real stored password. Not used here - the Microsoft account is
#   deliberately passwordless (a prior unauthorized-access incident is why),
#   and adding a password back just to satisfy this would undo that. Kept
#   only for reference in case that decision changes later.
#
# Switching modes later is safe: change $Mode and re-run this script.
# Register-ScheduledTask -Force overwrites the existing task definition in
# place - no need to unregister first, no effect on the proxy code itself.
