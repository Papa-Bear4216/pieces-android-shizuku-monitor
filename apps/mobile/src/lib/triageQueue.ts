// haven't been triaged yet, then flushes. Call this on app foreground
// (App.tsx mount) — that's the ONLY time AICore was found to actually run
// inference (see passiveCapture.ts's comment). A background capture can sit
// in the queue raw for anywhere from seconds to days depending on how often
// the app is opened; triage always catches up before anything is sent.
//
// Deliberately sequential, not parallel — each real inference call takes
// ~2-3s, and OnDeviceTriagePlugin's own in-flight guard would just drop
// concurrent calls anyway. A large backlog triages slowly but correctly,
// which is the right tradeoff over dropping summaries under load.
